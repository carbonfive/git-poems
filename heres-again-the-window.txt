Here's again the window, 
Where nobody sleep.
Maybe they're drinking wine, or
Maybe they're simply sitting.
Or maybe they two can't break
The union of their hands.
Perfectly you'd find, friend, 
In every house the same.
Shouts of partings and meetings -
In window in the night! 
Maybe - the hundreds of candles, 
May be - the three in one time...
No any rest, no rest any
To my excited mind.
In my house there appeared 
Something disturbing one.
Not from the candles, or light, 
The darkness had burned into fire.
That from the sleepless eyes! 
Please, pray, oh friend, 
for my such sleepless house, 
And for my window shining!
